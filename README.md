The purpose of this repository is to be a container for all my projects within the JavaScript course at Tech Academy.

These are some small projects I made using JavaScript:

  - Pizza Menu: https://github.com/GaspalCatalin/JavaScript_Projects/tree/main/Pizza_Project
  - Tic-Tac-Toe Game: https://github.com/GaspalCatalin/JavaScript_Projects/tree/main/TicTacToe
  - Calculator: https://github.com/GaspalCatalin/JavaScript_Projects/tree/main/Calculator
  - Todo app: https://github.com/GaspalCatalin/JavaScript_Projects/tree/main/todo_app

Pizza Menu
This project is a menu used to order pizza with a various selection of toppings. 
It then takes the input information and calculates the price for the order.

Tit-Tac-Toe Game
The classic game of tic-tac-toe. The player starts and the computer responds almost instantly, randomly. 
Contains sounds and graphics in case of a win or a draw. Restarts as soon as the game ends.

Calculator
A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version.

Todo app
A classic todo app. The user can add and remove items in a list.
